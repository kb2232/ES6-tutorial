/*
  Javascript executes your code line by line WITH no pauses.
  Promises allows you to wait OR pause before executing the next code

  There are tree states of Promise:
  1. unresolved - waiting for something to finish
  2. resolved - something finished and all went well
    a. then() - this is a callback to CATCH the result of what went well.
  3. rejected - something finished and something went bad
    a. catch() - this is a callback to CATCH something that went bad.
